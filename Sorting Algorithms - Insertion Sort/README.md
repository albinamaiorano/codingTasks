# Sorting Algorithm - Insertion Sort

## Description
This task involves implementing the insertion sort algorithm in Python. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list one item at a time. It iterates through the list, removes one element, and then inserts it into the correct position in the already-sorted part of the list.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `insertion_sort.py` file.
2. Import the `insertion_sort` function into your Python script.
3. Create a list to be sorted and pass it to the `insertion_sort` function.
4. Example usage:
    ```python
    from insertion_sort import insertion_sort

    arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
    print("Original array:", arr)
    insertion_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", arr)
    ```
