# 🚀 Coding Tasks 🛠️

## Description
This repository contains a collection of coding tasks covering various topics such as algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, recursion, and SQL querying. Each topic is organized into separate folders, with each folder containing a Python script and a README file providing additional information.

## Folder Structure
- **Algorithms - Quick Sort**: Implementation of the quick sort algorithm.
- **Data Structures - Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure.
- **Data Structures - Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure.
- **Data Structures - Linked List**: Implementation of a linked list data structure.
- **OOP - Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Implementation of object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Recursion - Fibonacci Series**: Implementation of generating Fibonacci series using recursion.
- **Searching Algorithms - Binary Search**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- **Sorting Algorithms - Insertion Sort**: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
- **SQL - Querying a Database**: Information and examples on querying a database using SQL.
